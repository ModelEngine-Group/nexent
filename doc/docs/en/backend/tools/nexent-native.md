# Nexent Native Tools

## 🧭 Scope

Nexent native tools are developed and maintained in the official repository. If you need custom capabilities, contribute directly under `sdk/nexent/core/tools` following the existing tool patterns.

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

- Build new tools alongside existing ones in `sdk/nexent/core/tools` (e.g., file, search, email, multimodal).
- Follow the conventions documented in [Tools](../../sdk/core/tools) for structure, inputs, and messaging.
- Keep comments/docstrings in English and align with repository rules.

## 🤝 Contribution Path

- Submit contributions to the Nexent official repo; external hosting is not supported for native tools.
- Reference existing implementations and [Contributing](../../contributing) for PR workflow and standards.
