## ‚öôÔ∏è Configure System Models

After adding models, you need to configure the system base model, which will be used for basic functions such as title generation and real-time file reading. When agents are running, you can specify specific models for each agent.

### Base Model Configuration
The system base model is used for core platform functions, including:
- Title generation
- Real-time file reading
- Basic text processing

**Configuration Steps:**
- Click the base model dropdown to select a model from the added large language models as the system base model.

### Agent Model Configuration
When creating and configuring agents, you can specify specific models for each agent:
- Each agent can independently select the large language model to use
- Support configuring different models for different agents to meet various business needs
- Agent model configuration will be set in the agent configuration page

## ‚úÖ Check Model Connectivity

Regularly checking model connectivity is important for stable system operation. With the connectivity check feature, you can promptly discover and resolve model connection issues, ensuring service continuity and reliability.

**Check Process:**
- Click the "Check Model Connectivity" button
- The system will automatically test the connection status of all configured system models

**Status Indicators:**
- üîµ **Blue dot:** Checking, please wait
- üî¥ **Red dot:** Connection failed, check configuration or network
- üü¢ **Green dot:** Connection normal, model is available

**Troubleshooting Suggestions:**
- Check if the network connection is stable
- Verify that the API key is valid and not expired
- Confirm the service status of the model provider
- Check firewall and security policy settings

For detailed configuration information about model providers, please refer to our **[Model Provider Guide](../getting-started/model-providers)**.
